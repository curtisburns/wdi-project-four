## Brief
Technical Requirements

Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. ALLOW time for this.
Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
Have automated tests for at least one RESTful resource on the back-end, and at least one classical and one functional component on the front-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
